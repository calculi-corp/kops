## kops delete instance

Delete an instance.

### Synopsis

Delete an instance. By default, it will detach the instance from the instance group, drain it, then terminate it.

```
kops delete instance INSTANCE|NODE [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Delete an instance from the currently active cluster.
  kops delete instance i-0a5ed581b862d3425 --yes
  
  # Delete an instance from the currently active cluster using node name.
  kops delete instance ip-xx.xx.xx.xx.ec2.internal --yes
  
  # Delete an instance from the currently active cluster without
  validation or draining.
  kops delete instance --cloudonly i-0a5ed581b862d3425 --yes
```
