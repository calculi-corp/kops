## Cinder CSI snapthot controller changes

The CSI Cinder plugin for OpenStack will now only use the CSI snapshotter when the CSI snapshot controller is enabled in the cluster spec.

This changes the default behavior where the CSI snaphotter container was always present, but spammed the log with error messages (see [#13890](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13890))

So in case of manually deployed CRDs to make the snapshotter work it is now necessary to [enable the snapshot controller](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#snapshot-controller).

## kOps CLI no longer accepts cluster name as positional argument

Prior to kOps 1.25, one could pass cluser name as a CLI argument to most functions. E.g `kOps get <clustername>`. As of kOps 1.25, kOps commands only accepts the cluster name through the `--name` flag or the `KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable. The one exception to this change is the `kops get cluster` command, which still accepts one or more cluster names as positional arguments.

This change is behind a feature flag. For now, one can revert to the old behavior by setting `KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=PositionalClusterArg`.
